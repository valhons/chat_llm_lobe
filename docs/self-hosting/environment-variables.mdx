## Building a Custom Image with Overridden NEXT_PUBLIC Variables

If you need to override NEXT_PUBLIC environment variables, you can build a custom Docker image using GitHub Actions
without forking the entire LobeChat repository. Here's a guide on how to do this:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your custom build.

2. In your new repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.

3. Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `build-custom-lobe.yml`. You can find
example [here](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/.github/workflows/custom-build.yml).

4. In your GitHub Repository settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets,
add any NEXT_PUBLIC variables you want to override

5. Set "Read and write" permissions for workflows in  Repository settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions.

6. To build your custom image, go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository and manually trigger the
"Build Custom LobeChat Image" workflow.

This approach allows you to create a custom build with your desired NEXT_PUBLIC variables without maintaining
a full fork of the LobeChat repository. You can trigger a new build whenever you need to update your custom image.
